This is a short note for the experience I had with javascript development with third party tools. I am using notepad++, you could find it from...<br /><div><a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">http://notepad-plus-plus.org/</a></div><div><br /></div><div>This is a easy to use editor which I've been using for quite a few years.&nbsp;</div><h3>HTML Autocomplete</h3><div>I used to create html from plain text. But autocomplete feature is nice which increases productivity. Notepad++ does have autocomplete capability but by default is disabled. After googling a bit. Here is the setting</div><div><br /></div><div><i>Settings-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Backup/AutoCompletion-&gt;Auto-Completion</i></div><div><br /></div><div>You can check the options, then when you go back to html file, start typing, the suggestions will come up. Same applies to javascript, but if you are looking for the feature like Intellisense in Visual Studio, this is still far from enough. e.g. when you type "win", the editor will suggest you "window", but you put a period there, nothing shows up...</div><h3>HTML auto-endtag</h3><div>when you type &lt;div&gt; surely you want to end the tag by &lt;/div&gt; but you will need to install a plugin <b>TextFx </b>for this feature. To install the plug-in,&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><i>Plugins-&gt;Plugin Manager-&gt;Show Plugin Manager</i></div><div><br /></div><div>in the dialog box, choose "TextFx" and click "Install" after installation is done, you will need to restart notepad++. Just do it. Then you will need to enable the feature by&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><i>TextFx-&gt;TextFx Settings-&gt;Auto Close XHTML/HTML Tag</i></div><div><br /></div><div>There are also other settings to auto close brackets, you can try it yourself.</div><h3>JSLint</h3><div>Here comes to the topic I want to try today, <b>JSLint</b>, which is a tool to scan your <b>javascript </b>and suggest any potential problems or improvements. It is like <b>Fxcop </b>for <b>.NET. </b>Again, there is a plug-in called JSLint, simply follow instruction above to locate and install the plug-in. Then open a js file and execute the scan via hotkey, <i>Ctrl+Shift+F5</i>. You will then see a list of items at the <b>JSLint </b>sub-window. it is nice and easy to use.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>There is a package called <b>JSHint</b>, which is forked from <b>JSLint </b>with the same creator. <b>JSHint </b>integrates with node JS and provide CLI application to scan via the code. I will leave this topic to later post.</div><div><br /></div><div>In any case, for small application or single developer application, the <b>notepad++</b> plugin will be enough. For larger scale projects, I will need to explore more on how to integrate <b>JSLint</b>/<b>JSHint </b>to build process (surely js doesn't require compilation, For example, if a project involves a few developers, every time a developer commit a change to svn and the JSLint will be triggered and generate a report, that will be nice. This is what we've done for .NET application, in web application, we are obviously expecting same thing. wait for my later post to give update on this.&nbsp;</div><h3>Snippet</h3><div>I didn't spend too much time on this but I found another plugin called <b>FingerText </b>which is providing snippet for variety of languages. I tried but not really know how can make it useful, do let me know if there are any good tutorials.</div>
