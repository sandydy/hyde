These days I am preparing for a new web application project, I've surfed on the internet a lot to find variety of javascript packages for a SPA.<br /><br />There are a couple of acronyms and frameworks found so far...<br /><h3>Acronyms</h3><ul><li>AMD, async module definition, is almost a must for javascript module to avoid dependency which introduces javascript initialization precedences</li><li>MV*, a term I first heard from Ryan Keeter, basically it stands for Model View *, and the * could be ViewModel/ Controler / X (which I dont know yet)</li></ul><h3>Frameworks &amp; Libraries</h3><div>There are really a list of libraries available on the internet for each of the areas.</div><h4>DOM</h4><div>Many of these libraries exist for a couple of years back to IE5/6 or even earlier. People were looking for single JS library to encapsulate behaviors against different browsers.</div><div><ol><li><a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">JQuery</a>, provides a list of ways to access DOM elements and encapsulate browser specific implementation to programmer, this is obviously a MUST have for next generation web application</li><li><a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/" target="_blank">DoJo</a>, as far as I know, rival of JQuery, but I've never been using this.</li><li><a href="http://mootools.net/" target="_blank">MooTools</a>, framework comes from MIT for a complete OO js. Don't have much time on this, but from time to time I see this lib being used or discussed</li><li><a href="http://prototypejs.org/">Prototype.js</a>, another package to extend DOM. I wouldn't have time to drill into details yet</li></ol></div><div><h4>Model View Controller/ViewModel Frameworks</h4></div><div>In recent years especially after HTML 5 was introduced, more logics are shipped to the client. Web client which was originally thin is becoming thicker. These libraries are collections of libraries to address variety of problems. Some of them are MV* &nbsp;specific, but from what I understand, at least first two of them contains more than just MV*. Simply speaking, all libraries uses HTML 5 data attribute to provide ways to do data-binding.</div><div><div><ol><li><a href="http://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>, Google maintained library. Instead of using JQuery like most of the other lib, it contains JQuery light which is a modified version. It also has a list of other packages included, the main idea getting out of it is that AngularJS implements MVC, which is a way Google thinks what a web is. In this article, I am not going to go through details but I would say the way they do binding in the view is cleaner.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="http://durandaljs.com/" target="_blank">DurandalJS</a>, originally I found only a few information from DurandalJS. Ultimately I found that this is a integration of <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">KnockedOut </a>(MVVM), <a href="http://sammyjs.org/" target="_blank">SammyJS</a>, <a href="http://requirejs.org/" target="_blank">RequireJS</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">JQuery</a>, etc.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">BackboneJS</a></li></ol></div><h4>Language Quality Lib</h4><div>I used to love these libraries as they are telling you something traditionally compiler wont tell, and those problems are hit in runtime. In any case, these libraries are more valuable in javascript as it doesn't have compiler or you will see the problem at the end in browser.Both libraries provide web interface and you can put the js to the web and it will generate a decent report. JSHint is integrated with Node JS. But in general, this is essential to be in javscript continuously integration process when multiple developers are working together. These lib provides cohesive programming style and avoid runtime issues</div><div><div><ol><li><a href="http://www.jshint.com/" target="_blank">JSHint</a>, this is fork from JSLint, didn't really drill into details. It has CLI as Node js module. I didn't try, someone said its better but anways, didn't find a good tutorial for usage in windows</li><li><a href="http://www.jslint.com/" target="_blank">JSLint</a>, basically same thing as JSHint. The reason I use this because as my <a href="http://sandydychan.blogspot.com/2013/10/web-application-development-101.html" target="_blank">previous post</a> suggested, JSLint can be integrated with Notepad++ (my favourite editor). That why I am using this.&nbsp;</li></ol></div></div><h4>Modulize Lib</h4></div><div>Putting javascript into &lt;script&gt; tag is too difficult to mange when application is becoming larger. RequireJS simply is the one and only I found that majority is using to provide references across files / js modules.</div><div><ol><li><a href="http://requirejs.org/" target="_blank">RequireJS</a>, provide patterns to define dependencies per js files. When application is growing big, developer doesn't need to care about which lib is defined or not.</li></ol></div><h4>Rounting Lib</h4><div>I've only tried SammyJS but I remember Ryan Keeter has a couple of others suggested, probably you can follow the reference link at the bottom and try it yourself.</div><div><ol><li><a href="http://sammyjs.org/" target="_blank">SammyJS</a>, handy lib to define what happens after the hash sign of a page. It simply provides a method for you to provide callback handles when a particular hash value is submitted. It also supports RESTful hash navigation path</li></ol></div><h4>Styling, View specific</h4><div><ol><li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap JS</a>, originated in Twitter and is open source to prepare a set of stylesheets and components for consistent UI styling. It works with DoJo, Jquery, AngularJS. Some suggest that Bootstrap JS was not originally designed for HTML5 CSS3, but at least the round corner is. I will explore a bit more and provide a future post if there are other findings</li><li><a href="http://jqueryui.com/" target="_blank">JQuery UI</a>, one of the very earliest library to provide UI control libraries and cross platform supported, I used to use this for many years. Solid, never disappointed.</li><li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb398874.aspx" target="_blank">MS AJAX</a>, I used to use this lib intensively with ASP.NET with they first introduce client side AJAX control. Components, Controls, etc. they basically provided a way to connect client and server and provide capbility to connect to the web server hosted web service.&nbsp;</li></ol><h4>Unit Test</h4></div><div><ol><li>qUnit, Mocha, Jasmine, these are all libraries I've heard from Ryan Keeter, no time to go through them yet. Will find out more details and continue with another blog post.</li><li><a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/" target="_blank">Selenium</a>, I used to use this library for a couple years to record and replay whatever happen on the browser, this is perfect for stress test, load test, or automated test.</li></ol><h4>Storage</h4></div><div><ol><li>BreezeJS, AmplifyJS,&nbsp;these are all libraries I've heard from Ryan Keeter, no time to go through them yet. Will find out more details and continue with another blog post.</li></ol><h4>Backend Server</h4></div><div><ol><li><a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a>, hottest thing in the industry. Using javascript to provide http server logic via NodeJS, it then uses javascript engine by Google and used in Chrome to provide the capbility.&nbsp;</li></ol><div><h4>Language Supplement Lib</h4><div>These libraries do not fit in other categories, but I love both of them well.&nbsp;</div><div><ol><li><a href="http://underscorejs.org/" target="_blank">Underscore.js</a>, utility library which I found it useful syntactically.</li><li><a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">Typescript</a>, I didn't spend too much time with it. But this is a real brilliant idea which provides a high-level syntax to define objects and then compile to javascript. It provides a pretty decent way to avoid ambiguity in javascript as it is always a problem since day one. This is definitely a future of javascript, but just a matter that if the idea could be adopted by majority.</li></ol></div></div></div><h4>Reference</h4><div>When I was surfing for different libraries. Most of them come from a couple of sources...</div><div><ol><li><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide?hl=zh-TW#Libraries" target="_blank">Google CDN</a></li><li><a href="http://www.asp.net/ajaxlibrary/cdn.ashx" target="_blank">MS CDN</a></li><li><a href="http://ryankeeter.com/angularjs-vs.-durandaljs-%E2%80%93-part-1-on-n-%E2%80%93-where-do-these-technologies-fit" target="_blank">Ryan Keeter's Blog</a></li></ol><div>Feel free to correct me if there is anything wrong above. In any case, the area still missing includes but not limited to Notification (e.g. pusher), Web Service Proxy (e.g. WCF, svc and its javascript proxy, but for other web service or in general RESTful web service, any tools to generate proxy in js), merge, minify and compress javascript for performance (surely if you are using ASP.NET, script manages handle all these) Anyways, this is only a beginning, more to come in my blog.</div></div>
